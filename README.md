### About the project

This project is an analysis done on the forex prices from MetaTrader5 (MT5). The analysis is in the form of a dashboard, which have the following features:

* Currency Strength Analysis
* Risk Management Analysis
* Price action trading
* Support and Resistance
* Relative Strength Index (RSI) Divergences

In the trading community, it is recommended that you should have two different charts when viewing the same forex market: one for analysis, one for making your trades. Hence, the need for a second dashboard (which is this project itself! :laughing:).
