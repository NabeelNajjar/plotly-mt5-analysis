### About the project

This project is based

This project consists of a dashboard that has the following features:

* Currency Strength Analysis
* Risk Management Analysis
* Price action trading
* Support and Resistance
* Relative Strength Index (RSI) Divergences

In the trading community, it is recommended that you should have two different charts when viewing the same forex market: one for analysis, one for making your trades. Hence, the need for a second dashboard.

Some of the features were not available and required calculation by hand (**Currency Strength Analysis**).
